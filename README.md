# Text Modifier web app ![ReactJS](./library-React-red.svg)

    My first React app, which takes in text input from the user and modifies it according to their requirements.
    The app uses basic ReactJS functionalities like "props" and "state" management. I've used Bootstrap 5 for the UI design.

### Top project functionalities include:

- Generating random text
- Changing input to upper/lower case
- Copying text to clipboard
- Clearing text to provide a blank input field
- Hopping between dark mode and light mode as per user's choice
